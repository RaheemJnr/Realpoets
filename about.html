<h2>About realnaijapoets</h2>
<p><strong>Realnaijapoets</strong> is a website that intend to give voice to poetry writers who don't have one <br>
put pen in the hands of great poets to display their art, intelligence and let them speak from <br>the deep part
of their minds, i kmow alot of them are denied these wonderful priveledges beacuse i <br> was once in that position.
So i am using this priveledge to implore great writers and from around the world to<br> speak using newly found voice.
